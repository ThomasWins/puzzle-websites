# Puzzle Websites with jQuery, HTML, and CSS
This project demonstrates the use of **jQuery, HTML,** and **CSS** to create two interactive puzzle websites. Each puzzle incorporates dynamic user interaction with jQuery to enhance the user experience.

## Features:
- **Puzzle 1:** A classic sliding puzzle, where users rearrange pieces to solve the puzzle.
- **Puzzle 2:** A jigsaw puzzle, where users drag and drop pieces into place.

Both puzzles are designed with a clean, responsive layout using **HTML** and **CSS**, with **jQuery** used to manage interactivity, animations, and user input.
